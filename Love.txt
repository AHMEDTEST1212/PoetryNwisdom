I was reminded of thy presence
the love and the said lover
cursed be love and its essence
let her be the comer and goer

Let the vultures sing and eat 
what remains of the lovers lies
May i wait, no! beaten and beat
beaten by the wait and the sighs

I sit front the gates and ponder
Sooth be told, sooth be killed
I hide from the king's plunder
Thy love mine given to the skilled

Wait beyond the wall ye lust
you live not within us, the pure
Leave a trail but take all thy dust
Love shall pervail pure to the core

I walk, walk and walk and walk
I let the nights of ink spread
its hours sing, cry and talk
Bless are the lips of led
