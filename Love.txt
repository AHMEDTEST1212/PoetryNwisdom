I was reminded of thy presence
the love and the said lover
cursed be love and its essence
let her be the comer and goer

Let the vultures sing and eat 
what remains of the lovers lies
May i wait, no! beaten and beat
beaten by the wait and the sighs

I sit front the gates and ponder
Sooth be told, sooth be killed
